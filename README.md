# FDA_Drugs_INSIGHT
Supplement to Health Apps that shows the likelihood of a serious reaction to drugs. Project for Insight Fellows


People are routinely frightened by the results of online health app, albeit irrationally. In this work I utilize data from the FDA on adverse help effects to predict the outcome of an adverse effect, given that it should occur. I utilize a range of wrangling techniques along with a random forest classifier and unsupervised clustering models to outline the probabilities of a serious event given an adverse case. 

Necessary packages:
- scki-kit learn, pandas, numpy, django, urllib, matplotlib, seaborn
